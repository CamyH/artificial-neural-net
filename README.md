# Artificial Neural Net

"A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, published in 1943, was the foundational paper introduced the concept of artificial neurons, which laid the groundwork for neural networks.
We describe a simple ANN that uses typical activation functions.

## Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
Boids will represent the data to be optimized. they follow 3 simple rules:
[ ] ## Seperation
Tell the boids not to run into flockmates
[ ] ## Cohesion
The flock will move together to a single shared objective space with a common velocity.
[ ] ## Alignment
The the direction of the boid driver of the flock which changes based on who is on lead in the prevailing direction.
This inturn suggests the direction of each boid in the flock causing natural swarm patterns.
